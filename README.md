<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before diving into Gluco 24, let's understand a bit about blood sugar. It's the main source of energy for your body. When you eat, your body breaks down food into sugar (glucose) which enters your bloodstream. Insulin, a hormone, helps move glucose from your blood into your cells for energy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your blood sugar levels are too high (hyperglycemia), it can lead to serious health problems like diabetes. On the other hand, when they're too low (hypoglycemia), you can feel dizzy, weak, or shaky. Keeping your blood sugar levels in a healthy range is crucial for overall well-being.</span>
